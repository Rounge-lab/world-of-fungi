This repository contains all scripts, documents and information related to the evaluation of six bioinformatic tools (Kraken2, MetaPhlAn 3 and 4, FindFungi, FunOMIC, HumanMycobiomeScan and EukDetect) for their ability to classify fungal genomes. The evaluation was performed by Arfa Irej Qureshi for her Masters thesis during the academic year 2022/2023. 

The thesis is available at https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/104186.


Disclaimer: The evaluation of EukDetect (https://rdcu.be/dyb9m) and MetaPhlAn 4 was performed in February and January 2024, respectively, and thusly not included in the Master thesis.
