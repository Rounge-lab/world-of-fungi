The evaluation was performed by Arfa Irej Qureshi for her Masters thesis during the academic year 2022/2023. The thesis is available at https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/104186.

Disclaimer: The evaluation of EukDetect and MetaPhlAn4 was performed in February and January 2024, respectively, and thusly not included in the Master thesis.
