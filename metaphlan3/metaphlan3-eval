##This is a description of how the raw reads from the simulated dataset were mapped using MetaPhlAn3

##MetaPhlAn3 (version 3.0.7) was loaded into the environment
$ module load MetaPhlAn/3.0.7-foss-2020b

##Mapping the raw reads (paired-end) of the simulated datasets
$ metaphlan -input_type fastq ~/inputfile1.fq -o filename1.txt 
$ metaphlan -input_type fastq ~/inputfile2.fq -o filename2.txt
