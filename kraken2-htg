##The process of mapping raw reads from the simulated dataset using Kraken 2

##Curating custom databases
##The standard Kraken 2 database does not include fungal genomes. So we curated two custom databases: PlusPF and FungiDB.

##PlusPF was downloaded from https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2. 
##Extract contents of the downloaded file
$ tar -xvzf filename.tar.gz -C ~/directory


##Curating FungiDB
##Install taxonomy
$ kraken2-build --download-taxonomy --db FungiDB

#Install fungi library
$ kraken2-build --download-library fungi --db FungiDB

#Build database
$ kraken2-build --build --db FungiDB --threads 24

##No custom k-mer length (k) or minimizer length (l) were specified. The default values of k and l are 35 and 31, respectively. 


##A custom database (FMC_DB) was also curated to act as a positive control. This database contained the same fifty genomes as in the mock community. The database was curated in a similar manner as described above.


##Mapping raw reads to the custom databases
$ kraken2 --db $database --threads 16 --unclassified-out filename#.fq --classified-out filename#.fq --output filename.txt --report filename.txt --paired --use-names ~/filename1.fq ~/filename2.fq
